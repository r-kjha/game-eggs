## Configuration

### **Where is the Server Configuration Stored?**
The Enshrouded dedicated server configuration is stored in `enshrouded_server.json`, which is automatically managed by this egg.

Instead of manually editing this file, **you can set most key values directly in the Pterodactyl Panel** using environment variables.

---

### **How to Configure the Server**
**Most settings can be modified via Pterodactyl's environment variables.**  
Go to your **Pterodactyl Panel → Server Settings**, where you can edit:
- **Server Name (`SRV_NAME`)** – The name players will see in the server list.
- **User Group Passwords**:
  - **Admin Group (`SRV_PW`)** – Grants admin privileges.
  - **Friend Group (`SRV_PW2`)** – Grants reduced admin privileges.
  - **Guest Group (`SRV_PW3`)** – General access for users.
- **Max Players (`MAX_PLAYERS`)** – Number of player slots (1-16).
- **Steam Query Port (`QUERY_PORT`)** – The query port for server communication.

Other settings, such as **game settings, IP binding, and log locations**, are still managed in `enshrouded_server.json`

---

### **Default Configuration File (`enshrouded_server.json`)**
On first startup, the server will generate the following structure:

```json
{
    "name": "My Server",
    "saveDirectory": "./savegame",
    "logDirectory": "./logs",
    "ip": "0.0.0.0",
    "gamePort": 15636,
    "queryPort": 15637,
    "slotCount": 16,
    "userGroups": [
        {
            "name": "Admin",

        },
        {
            "name": "Friend",
            "password": "ChangeMe",
            "canAccessInventories": true,
            "canEditBase": true,
            "canExtendBase": true,
            "canKickBan": false,
            "reservedSlots": 1
        },
        {
            "name": "Guest",
            "password": "ChangeMe",
            "canAccessInventories": false,

            "canKickBan": false,
            "reservedSlots": 3
        }
    ]
}
```

### Server not showing in Serverlist?

The fact that the server is not displayed in the server list is a known problem.

As a workaround, you can add the server as a favourite via IP:port in the Steam server browser.
The server should then be at the top of the ingame server list
